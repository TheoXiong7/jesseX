                    Hockey has been my passion since I first stepped onto the ice at age five, 
                    but it's the lessons learned off the rink that have truly shaped who I am today.
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">
                    Growing up in a multicultural household, I learned early on that diversity is 
                    a strength, not a barrier. My parents, immigrants who sacrificed everything 
                    to give me opportunities they never had, instilled in me the values of hard work, 
                    humility, and giving back to the community that supports you.
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">
                    My journey in hockey hasn't been without its challenges. From being one of the 
                    few Asian players in many leagues to overcoming significant injuries that 
                    threatened my career, each obstacle has taught me resilience and empathy. 
                    These experiences opened my eyes to the barriers that many young athletes face, 
                    particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds.
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">
                    This realization sparked my commitment to social work and community advocacy. 
                    I believe that sports have the unique power to unite people across all 
                    boundaries â€“ economic, racial, and social. Through my various initiatives, 
                    I've seen firsthand how a simple act of mentorship or providing equipment 
                    to a kid who can't afford it can change the trajectory of their entire life.
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">
                    When I'm not on the ice or working with community programs, you'll find me 
                    reading about social psychology, learning new languages (currently working 
                    on my Spanish!), or exploring nature through hiking and photography. 
                    I believe that personal growth never stops, and every experience adds 
                    another layer to who we become.
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">
                    My goal extends beyond personal athletic achievements. I want to create 
                    lasting change in how we approach youth development in sports, making it 
                    more inclusive, supportive, and focused on developing character alongside 
                    skill. Every highlight reel moment on the ice is meaningless if it doesn't 
                    translate to positive impact in real life.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey. Whether you're 
                    here for the hockey highlights or interested in the social work, I hope 
                    you'll join me in believing that we all have the power to make a difference, 
                    one person, one community, one game at a time.
